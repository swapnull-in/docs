## Overview

Plans define what you're selling and how much it costs. Each plan has:

- **Name & Description** - What appears to customers
- **Interval** - Billing frequency (monthly, yearly, etc.)
- **Prices** - Amount in one or more currencies
- **Features** - What's included (for display)

## Create a Plan

<CodeGroup>
```typescript TypeScript
const plan = await recurso.plans.create({
  name: 'Pro Plan',
  description: 'For growing teams',
  interval: 'month',
  trial_days: 14,
  prices: [
    { amount: 4999, currency: 'INR' },  // ₹49.99
    { amount: 999, currency: 'USD' }    // $9.99
  ],
  features: [
    'Up to 10 team members',
    'Unlimited projects',
    'Priority support'
  ]
});
```

```bash cURL
curl -X POST https://api.recurso.dev/v1/plans \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Pro Plan",
    "description": "For growing teams",
    "interval": "month",
    "trial_days": 14,
    "prices": [
      { "amount": 4999, "currency": "INR" },
      { "amount": 999, "currency": "USD" }
    ]
  }'
```
</CodeGroup>

## Pricing Models

### Flat Rate

Simple fixed price per period:

```typescript
{
  name: 'Starter',
  interval: 'month',
  prices: [{ amount: 999, currency: 'INR' }]
}
```

### Per-Seat Pricing

Charge based on number of users:

```typescript
{
  name: 'Team Plan',
  interval: 'month',
  billing_scheme: 'per_unit',
  prices: [{ amount: 299, currency: 'INR' }],
  unit_label: 'user'
}

// When creating subscription
const subscription = await recurso.subscriptions.create({
  plan_id: 'plan_team',
  customer_id: customer.id,
  quantity: 5  // 5 users × ₹299 = ₹1495/month
});
```

### Tiered Pricing

Volume discounts based on quantity:

```typescript
{
  name: 'API Access',
  interval: 'month',
  billing_scheme: 'tiered',
  tiers_mode: 'graduated',  // or 'volume'
  tiers: [
    { up_to: 1000, unit_amount: 0.10 },    // First 1000: ₹0.10 each
    { up_to: 10000, unit_amount: 0.05 },   // Next 9000: ₹0.05 each
    { up_to: 'inf', unit_amount: 0.01 }    // Beyond: ₹0.01 each
  ]
}
```

<Note>
**Tiered vs Volume**: 
- `graduated` applies each tier to its own range
- `volume` applies the final tier rate to all units
</Note>

## Plan Intervals

| Interval | Value | Example |
|----------|-------|---------|
| Daily | `day` | Metered services |
| Weekly | `week` | Short-term access |
| Monthly | `month` | Most common |
| Yearly | `year` | Discounted annual |

For custom intervals, use `interval_count`:

```typescript
{
  interval: 'month',
  interval_count: 3  // Quarterly billing
}
```

## Trials

Add free trial periods to any plan:

```typescript
{
  name: 'Pro Plan',
  trial_days: 14  // 14-day free trial
}
```

<Info>
Trial subscribers don't pay until the trial ends. No payment method required during trial (configurable).
</Info>

## List Plans

```typescript
const plans = await recurso.plans.list({
  active: true,
  limit: 10
});

// Returns
{
  data: [
    { id: 'plan_starter', name: 'Starter', ... },
    { id: 'plan_pro', name: 'Pro', ... }
  ],
  has_more: false
}
```

## Archive a Plan

Archived plans can't be used for new subscriptions but existing subscriptions continue:

```typescript
await recurso.plans.archive('plan_old');
```

## Best Practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Version Plans" icon="code-branch">
    Create new plans instead of modifying prices. Existing subscribers keep their rates.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Multi-Currency" icon="coins">
    Add prices for each currency you accept. Recurso auto-selects based on customer location.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Clear Names" icon="tag">
    Use descriptive names customers will recognize on their credit card statements.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Feature Lists" icon="list-check">
    Include features for display on pricing pages. They're stored as metadata.
  </Card>
